Project Verse is being designed as a fully moddable Unity game in reference to Stardew Valley. All objects, events, worlds, cutscenes, and scripted actions will be implemented using the API.  The game itself will be taking place in the far future with heavy influences from the T.V. series Firefly. The player will crash into a small town, making friends with local villagers and while working on earning money. Eventually they will gain enough wealth to fix their ship and explore other worlds with different themes and quests all while promoting their budding enterprise of cargo trading, production, and crime.  Planned Features Crop Growing - plantable crops that grow over a given lifecycle and produce a sellable item Home Building - Add objects into home, decorative and functional Modular Ship Design - Build/Purchase upgrades to ship that reflect in its physical design Quests - Players will given quests to complete. Relationships - Players will be able to build friendships and and enemies with the NPCs. Morality - Players will be given choices over time that will change a players morality score and affect the lives of NPCs. Management - Players will be able to hire certain NPCS to do tasks for them, from handling crops, chopping trees, running cargo, or robbing ships. Automation - Players will slowly be able to add automation to their enterprise. Taking inspiration from Factorio with transportation and processing. With this, I want controllers to manipulate these machines to be fully programmable, presumably via LUA or possibly a Zachtronics inspired psuedo-assembly. However I'm uncertain how feasible this will be. Trading - There will be an influenceable economy that will affect what and how the player trades items and moves cargo. A lot more - I am planning on updating this readme over time.
